## 2. Implementation Progress

### 2.1 Feature Completion Overview

The Cheerly project has successfully implemented its core feature set through a systematic development approach. Our implementation spans four major content domains:

#### Music Integration
A sophisticated integration with Spotify's API enables mood-based music recommendations:
- Real-time mood analysis
- Personalized playlist generation
- Cross-platform synchronization

Implementation Evidence:
```kotlin
class SpotifyRepository(private val context: Context) {
    suspend fun getRecommendations(mood: String): List<Track> {
        val parameters = when (mood.lowercase()) {
            "happy" -> RecommendationParams(valence = 0.8f, energy = 0.7f)
            "sad" -> RecommendationParams(valence = 0.2f, energy = 0.3f)
            // Additional mood mappings
        }
        return apiService.getRecommendations(parameters)
    }
}
```

#### Video Content
YouTube integration provides targeted video suggestions:

```mermaid
